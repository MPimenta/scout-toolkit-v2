# Devlog System - Automated Blogging with Human Oversight

## Overview

This document outlines the automated devlog system for documenting the Scout Toolkit development journey. The system generates blog content from PRs and git history while maintaining a witty, Terry Pratchett-inspired tone that bridges technical insights with scouting context.

## Goals

- **Automated Content Generation**: Create blog posts from PRs and development progress
- **Scouting Context**: Emphasize how technical decisions help scout leaders
- **Authentic Voice**: Maintain witty, engaging tone throughout
- **Minimal Upkeep**: Smart defaults and templates reduce maintenance
- **Quality Control**: Human validation ensures content quality and tone consistency

## System Architecture

### Content Sources
- **PR Snippets**: Extracted from PR descriptions and comments
- **Git History**: Commit messages, file changes, progress tracking
- **Planning Integration**: Epic completion status from `planning.md`
- **Manual Input**: Human review and enhancement of automated content

### Content Pipeline
1. **Epic Completion** ‚Üí GitHub Action triggers content generation
2. **Content Created** ‚Üí Epic summary + git history + scouting insights
3. **Draft Generated** ‚Üí Markdown with frontmatter and tone templates
4. **Human Review** ‚Üí PR-based review process for validation
5. **Auto-Publish** ‚Üí Deployed to GitHub Pages via Astro

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Astro Blog Setup

```

### 2. PR Template Enhancement
```markdown
## What & Why
- [Technical changes]
- [Scouting impact]

## Devlog Snippet (Auto-blog content)
> **Scouting Context**: How this helps leaders bridge the gap between kids' needs and their knowledge
> **Technical Insight**: What we learned, trade-offs, surprises
> **Human Touch**: One witty observation or "aha moment"

## Labels
- `devlog` - Include in automated blog posts
- `scouting-focus` - Emphasize scouting impact
- `architecture` - Technical deep-dive worthy
- `epic-complete` - Mark epic completion
```

### 3. Tone Templates
```javascript
const TONE_TEMPLATES = {
  scouting_focus: "In the world of scouting, where every leader juggles the impossible task of keeping 20 kids engaged while secretly hoping they learn something useful...",
  
  technical_insight: "Sometimes the best solutions come from asking 'what would a scout leader actually need?' rather than 'what's the most elegant code?'",
  
  progress_update: "Another week, another step toward making scout leaders' lives slightly less chaotic...",
  
  epic_completion: "And so we reach the end of another epic, like a patrol returning from a successful expedition‚Äîtired, wiser, and with slightly fewer socks than we started with.",
  
  authentication: "Google sign-in now checks for @escoteiros.pt, like a nightclub bouncer who's read the guest list and your aura.",
  
  portuguese_interface: "We invited the UN's SDGs in; they arrived with icons and the air of honored relatives. Portuguese speaks first (as is only polite), and now it's the only language we need.",
  
  search_filters: "We taught the search bar to stop panicking when asked for 'less than 15 minutes but more than my patience.'",
  
  program_builder: "The Program Builder has discovered that time only loops if you forget to recompute end times. We gave it a pocket watch and a quiet word."
}
```

### 4. Content Generation Workflow

#### Epic Completion Posts
- **Trigger**: PR labeled `epic-complete` merged
- **Source**: Epic summary from `planning.md` + git history + related commits
- **Output**: Special completion post with progress overview
- **Review**: Enhanced review process for milestone posts

#### Manual Epic Posts
- **Trigger**: Manual GitHub Action trigger
- **Source**: Git history analysis + planning.md status
- **Output**: Retrospective post for completed epics
- **Review**: Standard review process
