#### Story 1.4.a: Portuguese-Only Refactor ✅
**Priority:** Critical
**Estimate:** 1-2 days
**Status:** Completed

**Rationale:**
After successfully implementing Story 1.4 (Internationalization Setup), we encountered persistent technical challenges:
- **Turbopack Compatibility Issues**: next-intl integration caused build failures and Edge Runtime conflicts
- **Next.js 15 Edge Runtime Limitations**: Complex middleware and dynamic imports not fully supported
- **Development Velocity Impact**: Time spent debugging i18n issues was delaying core functionality
- **Portuguese-First Strategy**: Since the platform is primarily for Portuguese scout leaders, we decided to prioritize core functionality over multilingual support

**Decision:** Refactor to Portuguese-only approach to stabilize the application and focus on delivering core value to users. Internationalization can be re-implemented later when the platform is stable and the technical ecosystem has matured.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Update documentation to reflect Portuguese-only approach
- [x] Remove next-intl dependencies and configuration
- [x] Simplify routing from /[locale] to direct routes
- [x] Hardcode Portuguese content in all components
- [x] Remove language switcher and locale validation
- [x] Update all internal links and navigation
- [x] Simplify build process and resolve Turbopack issues
- [x] Restore authentication configuration
- [x] Verify application works without internationalization

**Tasks:**
- [x] Update architecture.md, api.md, deployment.md, and README.md to reflect Portuguese-only approach
- [x] Uninstall next-intl package
- [x] Remove i18n.ts file and middleware.ts internationalization
- [x] Update routing structure (remove [locale] folder)
- [x] Convert all components to use Portuguese text directly
- [x] Remove translation keys and useTranslations hooks
- [x] Update all page components with hardcoded Portuguese content
- [x] Remove language switcher from navigation
- [x] Update all internal links to use direct routes
- [x] Simplify auth configuration and resolve TypeScript errors
- [x] Test all pages and functionality
- [x] Verify build process works without internationalization issues

**Notes:**
- Successfully resolved all Turbopack and next-intl integration issues
- Simplified the codebase and reduced complexity significantly
- Focused on core functionality for Portuguese scout leaders
- Can always add i18n back later when the app is stable and technical ecosystem matures
- Resolved all 500 errors and chunk loading issues
- Documentation updated to serve as reference during implementation
- ✅ Build process now works successfully
