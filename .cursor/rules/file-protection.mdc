# File Protection Rule

## Never Delete or Clear Files Without Permission

**CRITICAL:** Before deleting, clearing, or completely replacing any file content, you MUST ask for explicit user permission.

### What This Rule Covers:
- **File deletion** - Never delete files without asking first
- **File clearing** - Never remove all content from a file without asking first  
- **Complete file replacement** - Never replace entire file contents without asking first
- **Bulk file operations** - Never perform operations that affect multiple files without asking first
- **Folder deletion** - Never delete folders or directories without asking first
- **Migration files** - Never delete database migration files without asking first
- **Configuration files** - Never delete project configuration files without asking first
- **Database operations** - Never run database commands (migrate, seed, reset) without asking first
- **Data operations** - Never modify, clear, or reset database data without explicit permission

### When You Need Permission:
- ✅ **Safe operations** (editing specific sections, adding content, fixing bugs)
- ❌ **Destructive operations** (deleting files, clearing content, complete rewrites, folder deletions, database modifications)

### How to Ask for Permission:
1. **Explain what you want to do** - Be specific about the operation
2. **Explain why it's necessary** - What problem are you solving?
3. **Wait for explicit approval** - Don't proceed until user says "yes"
4. **Confirm before proceeding** - Double-check the user's intent

### Example Permission Request:
> "I need to completely rewrite the `ActivityFilters.tsx` file because the current structure has become corrupted and is causing build errors. This will replace all existing content. Do you give me permission to proceed with a complete rewrite?"

### Emergency Situations:
If a file is completely corrupted and unusable, explain the situation and ask for permission to restore it from a working version or recreate it entirely.

**Remember:** It's better to ask twice than to accidentally lose user content!
