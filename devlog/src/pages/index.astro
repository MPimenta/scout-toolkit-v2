			<h1>üèïÔ∏è Scout Toolkit Devlog</h1>
			<p>
				Welcome to the development blog for the Scout Toolkit project. This is where we document our journey
				building tools to help scout leaders bridge the gap between kids' needs and their knowledge.
			</p>
			<p>
				We're building a platform that helps scout leaders manage activities, create programs, and deliver
				meaningful experiences to their scouts. Every technical decision we make is guided by one question:
				"How does this help scout leaders do their job better?"

			<p>
				This blog is written with a Terry Pratchett-inspired wit, focusing on the human side of software development
				and how our technical choices impact the real-world work of scout leaders.
